            Super fine
            She was never lying
            Strutting in her heels
            Or her slides either way
            Eyes on her every single day, week, year
            Everyone wondering how she does it with no fear
            All that confidence wasn't heaven-sent
            Does it come within?
            Does it come run out?
            I don't know
            She'll just have 'em runnin'
            Out and in man they want to sin
            Talking deadly sin
